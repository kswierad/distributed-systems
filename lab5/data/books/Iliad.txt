BOOK I.
ARGUMENT.40
THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.
In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of
the neighbouring towns, and taken from thence two beautiful
captives, Chryseis and Briseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon,
and the last to Achilles. Chryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest
of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her; with which
the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of the siege. The
priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon,
entreats for vengeance from his god; who inflicts a pestilence on
the Greeks.
